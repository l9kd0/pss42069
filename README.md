# About this
This repository holds all source files used in the first project for course LINFO1252.

# How to run
Compile everything using `make` then `make test` to run all the tests. Once it's done, you can use `make graphs` to run the python scripts in order to generate the graphs.

# Output
All the graphs are stored inside the `graphs/` folder with the `.png` format.
